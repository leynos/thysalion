# User Guide

This guide explains how to use the generated Thysalion project after rendering
it from the template.

## Generated Tooling

Generated projects use Rust 2024, a pinned nightly toolchain, strict lint
settings, and documented starter code. Library projects render `src/lib.rs`.
Application projects render `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, release automation, and
`[package.metadata.binstall]` metadata for binary installation.

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so local debug builds
link quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` instead because LLVM coverage
tools expect LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

## Makefile Targets

The generated `Makefile` exposes these public targets:

- `make all` runs formatting checks, linting, tests, and spelling checks.
- `make check-fmt` verifies Rust formatting.
- `make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker with warnings denied.
- `make test` runs `cargo nextest run` when cargo-nextest is installed and
  falls back to `cargo test` otherwise. All projects also run doctests.
- `make build` builds the debug target.
- `make release` builds the release target.
- `make coverage` writes `lcov.info` using `cargo llvm-cov` and `lld`.
- `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with `cargo metadata` and runs
  `cargo audit` once from that root.
- `make markdownlint` checks Markdown files and enforces en-GB-oxendict
  spelling through the pinned `typos` release.
- `make spelling` refreshes the shared Oxford dictionary when its published
  source is newer than the ignored local cache, generates `typos.toml`, and
  checks Markdown prose.
- `make nixie` validates Mermaid diagrams.

Install `clang`, `lld`, `mold`, `python3`, and `cargo-audit` before running the
full generated workflow locally on Linux.
